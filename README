geoservice - IP to geolocation Web service
==========================================

Built on tornado_ this Web service allows you
to resolve IP addresses to their approximated
geographical locations based on the MaxMind
GeoIP databases.

Installation
------------
Clone the repository and set it up by running
buildout.

Use a DNS cache on the same server because
given a domain name, a look up is performed
for the IP address and then the location is
determined. It is better to keep DNS cached
in this case. (Pdnsd comes to mind).
